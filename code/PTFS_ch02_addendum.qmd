## Interactive Visualization with Plotly

Athought the textbook suggest proprietry programs for interactive data visualizations, there are multiple open source frameworks for this as well. A popular R library is plotly, which can be used to interactively interrogate plots as demonstrated below.

### Baregg Tunnel Traffic

```{r}
#| message: false
library(plotly)

TunnelTraffic <- read_excel(here::here("data", "TunnelTraffic.xls"),
                            col_types = c("date", "numeric"))
tt_raw_plt <- TunnelTraffic %>% 
  ggplot(aes(Day, `# Vehicles in tunnel`)) +
  geom_line(color = 'dark blue') +
  theme_light()

ggplotly(tt_raw_plt)
```

This plot doesn't match the one in the textbook, but I've chosen it because it is also effective for comparing the annual traffic volumes, and is easy to produce using the `gg_season` function from the fpp3 library. The text bookplot can be reproduced using standard ggplot2 functions (with `facet_wrap()`).
```{r}
monthly_traffic <- TunnelTraffic %>% 
  mutate(Month = yearmonth(Day)) %>% 
  group_by(Month) %>% 
  summarise(vehicles = mean(`# Vehicles in tunnel`)) %>% 
  as_tsibble(index = Month) 

traffic_plt <- monthly_traffic %>% 
  gg_season(vehicles) +
  labs(title = 'Baregg Tunnel Traffic',
       y = 'Average # of Vehicles/Month')

ggplotly(traffic_plt)
```


```{r}
tt_wday_plt <- TunnelTraffic %>% 
  mutate(`Day of Week` = weekdays(Day)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(Day, `# Vehicles in tunnel`, color = `Day of Week`)) +
  geom_line() +
  ylim(0,NA) +
  theme_light()

ggplotly(tt_wday_plt)
```

Plotly enables interactive filtering. Double click on `Day of Week` element in the legend to isolate a single day, subsequent clicks add additional days back to the displayed data. For example, by removing everything except Thursday and Saturday, you can reproduce the image below using the interactive plotly image above.
